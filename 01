<h1>Scanning a host with Nessus</h1>
Summary: In this project, I used Nessus Essentials to scan a Windows 10 virtual machine for vulnerabilities.<br />

<h2>Requirements</h2>

- Computer with internet connection
- Oracle VirtualBox 
- Virtual Machine ("VM") running in VirtualBox with MS Windows 10 installed
- Nessus Essentials installed on the VM

<h2>Steps to the Lab</h2>

<p>
1. I launched a scan of the VM and noted that Nessus Essentials had detected at least one vulnerability it assessed as being of "medium" severity (marked in orange).
